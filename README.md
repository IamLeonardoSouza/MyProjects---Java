# Binary Search

## Description

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list. The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the list in half and comparing the middle value with the element being searched for. If the middle value is less than the searched element, the search continues in the upper half of the list; otherwise, it continues in the lower half.

### Features

- **Fast search in sorted lists.**
- **Time complexity of O(log n).**
